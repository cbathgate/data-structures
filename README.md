# data-structures
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## sprint-one
The purpose of this project is to introduce students to the four instantiation patterns in JavaScript: functional, functional-shared, prototypal, and pseudoclassical. 

Students implemented the following data structures in this sprint: queue and stack

## sprint-two
The purpose of this project is to introduce students to some common data structures. 

- Binary search tree
- Graph
- Hash Table
